		<h1> Creative designer / Web designer/ Animator / Game designer/ Artist</h1>
                 
		<p>Hi! My name is Daisy Leming.
			As a creative thinker, I would like to expand my skills in a creative designer position.</p>

			<p>I will be graduating from Edith Cowan University with a Bachelor of Design, majoring in Games and Interactive design in the end of 2024. During my coursework, I also did some web design and experience design and I am an artist by nature.
			My dedication to creativity and design is shown by the variety of areas that I create daily, such as traditional painting, digital art, game development and interactive animation.</p>
				
			<p>In addition, I also:
				-	Have showcased my art in Fremantle’s Old Customs House.
				-	Showcased my art in multiple music festivals around Western Australia in 2023.
				-	Created my portfolio website from scratch.</p>
		
			<p>I know all about independent work but I enjoy working in teams too. As a designer, strategy is very important when tackling a problem. My creativity does not end there, I have also taken some units from programming side. Adobe Creative Suit apps are my go to when I need to design something.
			While I am currently located in Perth, I am also happy to consider relocating to Melbourne or Brisbane if I should be a successful candidate. I also don’t mind working from home as you also offer that type of work mode.
			</p>
