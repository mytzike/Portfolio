			<h1> Creative designer / Web designer/ Animator / Game designer/ Artist</h1>
                 
            <p>I’m <b>Daisy Leming</b>, and I’m thrilled to welcome you to my corner of the web. As I gear up for graduation from Edith Cowan University with a Bachelor of Design, majoring in Games and Interactive Design, I’m eager to share my journey with you.</p>

            <p>Throughout my coursework, I've delved into the realms of web design, experience design, and, of course, my natural passion for artistry. From traditional painting to digital art, and from game development to interactive animation, I thrive on the diverse palette of creative expression.
			</p>
            <p>This website isn't just a digital storefront—it's a passion project, a testament to my commitment to creativity in all its forms. Crafted from scratch, this site is more than just a portfolio; it’s a canvas where I showcase not only my artistic endeavors but also my skills in web design. </p>
